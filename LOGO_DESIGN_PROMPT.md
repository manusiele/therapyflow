- Modern card-based layouts
- Soft shadows and subtle animations

### Final Notes
- The logo should feel modern and trustworthy
- It should work well alongside the blue gradient buttons used throughout the app

- Ensure it's distinctive and memorable
- The design should convey professionalism while remaining approachable
